# Summary

A laser cutted shadow throwing lamp in the shape of a dodecahedron made out of 3mm plywood. The description of the project can be found here https://fablab-wuerzburg.de/projekte/dodekaeder-lampe.
 For the light source a 10W halogen lamp is used. Because lamp sockets differs you have to design your own socket. In "lamp_socket.dxf" is a prototype.

You need to cut only all the "all_parts_X"-dxf files, if you don't want to change the design. Therefore you need a laser cutter with a working area of minimum 500mm x 300mm.

If you want to redesign some parts, dxf-files of all single parts are also uploaded.
Here is a list of the number of the single parts you have to cut.


- 11x     "face.dxf"
- 1x       "bottom.dxf"
- 5x       "base.dxf"
- 100x   "joint_face_face.dxf"
- 20x     "joint_face_bottom.dxf"
- 5x       "joint_base_base.dxf"
- 1x       "lamp_socket.dxf" or modified lamp socket

I should mention that the light source should be as small as possible to obtain a sharp shadow
